> *A passion since 1996*

---

After having worked in the design offices of Disney in Florida, as well as at THX "Lucasfilms" in California, we created our first company in 1996 dedicated to the integration of new technologies, adapted to private and professional interior spaces. .

Bringing together areas related to light management (LUTRON), audio-video and home automation (AMX, CONTROL4), we have since carried out dozens of projects all over the world.
