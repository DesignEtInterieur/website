# Custom furniture

> *Made-to-measure: the ideal solution*

---

In many projects, the optimization of spaces can only be achieved with the help of custom-designed and manufactured furniture. Unfortunately, for a long time, this solution was a luxury that we regularly came up against. So I took the resolution to travel all over Europe to fix it. For a decade now, I have created direct collaborations with high-performance factories in Poland and Portugal offering us high quality solutions at very affordable prices.

- Creation of kitchens,
- creation of storage and dressing rooms,
- libraries,
- and any other creation where only your imagination will take you.
  
Thanks to in-house designs and perfect ergonomics, you will therefore have all the possibilities of finishing and organization.
